* git clone - Clone a repository into a new directory.

** Example
- ~gg clone -b main --depth 1 github.com:haoran-mc/dotfiles.git~
  - =-b, --branch=       Instead of pointing the newly created HEAD to the branch pointed to by the cloned repository’s HEAD, point to <branch-name> branch instead.
  - =--depth=            Create a shallow clone with a history truncated to the specified number of commits.
    ␣                  You may need use =--single-branch= to fetch the histories near the tips of single branch.
